### Arcade Hobby

A long past time of mine has been purchasing and restoring classic arcade machines.

One of my favorite projects of the past little while was disassembling and rebuilding a NEO GEO "Big Red" arcade cabinet.

I modified the main PCB with a watch battery to maintain system settings and high scores, as the previous battery had been soldered onto the main circuit board by the original manufacturer.

I also restored the CRT monitor inside the machine by replacing the capacitors on the main neckboard. This resolved all of the ghosting and vertical lines that were a product of old and dying capacitors.

Overall I think it turned out pretty great!
